# Invert Dialogue Background Color
Inverts the text background fill color in dialogue boxes to suit ASCII sheets with white text on black background. Typically, GBS users need to place \007\002 in front of text in a dialogue box to invert the background fill colors, this plugin will ensure you no longer need to put that before all your text throughout an entire project.
